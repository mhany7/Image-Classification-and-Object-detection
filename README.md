# **Image Classification and Object Detection**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing an advanced **Image Classification** and **Object Detection** system using deep learning techniques. The system aims to classify objects in images and detect their precise locations, enhancing image processing capabilities for various real-world applications such as security, healthcare, and autonomous driving.  

## **Objectives**  
- Develop an **image classification** system to classify objects in images.  
- Implement **object detection** to accurately locate objects in images.  
- Improve the **speed** and **accuracy** of image processing.  
- Optimize the system for real-time applications.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)  
- **Deep Learning** (Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification)  
- **Object Detection Models** (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)  
- **Image Processing** (OpenCV)  
- **GitHub Projects** (for task management)
